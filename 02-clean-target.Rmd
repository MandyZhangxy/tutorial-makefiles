### Phony Targets

[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), commonly known as __make__,
is a Unix tool that is part of the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/software/).

Make is a "tool which controls the generation of executables and other 
non-source files of a program from the program's source files."

To work with Make you write a text file with the name `Makefile`, 
typically referred to as the _makefile_.

A makefile is formed with __rules__ that have the following structure:
```make
target: dependencies ...
	commands
	...
```

A __rule__ tells Make how to execute a series of commands in order to build
a __target__ file from source files (i.e. the __dependencies__)

Under its most basic form, a rule usually has this structure:
```make
target: dependency
	command
```
